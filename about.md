My name is <em><strong>Alex Lueck</em></strong> and I am an aspiring <em><strong>Game Designer</em></strong> from a small town in Wisconsin. After high school, I moved to Chicago and studied at <em><strong>Columbia College Chicago</em></strong> where I gained training on industry standard tools, equipment, and practices. While attending I was given countless opportunities to display my leadership and management skills. I'm a quick learner who's always looking to jump into something new and challenging.
