My name is Alex Lueck and I am a Simulation, Software, and Game Developer. 

Currently I am a Contract Game Tester for Jackbox Games working on The Jackbox Party Pack 7 and Quiplash 2 InterLASHtional. Previously, I worked as Quality Assurance Analyst with Jackbox Games on the Jackbox Party Pack 6 and as an Associate Game Designer working on Mutant Football League for Digital Dreams Entertainment, (previously from 2015-2/18). From 2018 to 2019 I was a Contract Game Designer working on Madden 19 and Madden 20 at EA Sports. From 2015 and 2016 I was a Simulation and Software Designer for ARX.    

I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in the Game Design Major at Columbia College Chicago. Working in this industry has given me the opportunity to develop and hone my arsenal of skills. My passion for creating is what drives my desire to be a part of this industry. I'm a quick learner who's always looking to jump into something new and exciting.
