My name is Alex Lueck and I am a freelance Simulation, Software, and Game Developer.For the last year I have been a Contract Designer working on Madden 19 and Madden 20 at EA Sports. From 2015 to 2018 I was an Associate Game Designer working on Mutant Football League for Digital Dreams Entertainment. From 2015 to 2016 I was a Simulation and Software Designer for ARX.  

I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in the Game Design Major from Columbia College Chicago. Working in this industry has given me the opportunity to develop a wide arsenal of skills. My passion for creating is what drives my desire to be a part of this industry. I'm a quick learner who's always looking to jump into something new and exciting.
