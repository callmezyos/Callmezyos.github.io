My name is Alex Lueck and I am an aspiring Game Designer from a small town in Wisconsin. After high school, I moved to Chicago and studied at Columbia College Chicago where I gained training on industry standard tools, equipment, and practices. While attending I was given countless opportunities to display my leadership and management skills. I'm a quick learner who's always looking to jump into something new and challenging.
