##Small fish in a huge pond
GDC Day 1 was crazy to say the least. I got to the Roscone Center a little late but as soon as I got there
I just jumped right in. I found a little group to walk around with which actually turned out for the better. 
Walking around and talking to people I found was much easier to do in a group setting where we all just 
kinda helped eachother out. I was with the artist from my Indie Team Game and his girlfriend.
