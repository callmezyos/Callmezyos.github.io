## Why I'm Here
Well I came to Columbia because mainly it was the only school that offered a Bachelors in Game Design that I was looking at attending.
After doing the campus visit, it was love at first sight.

I ended up in this class because when I first took AIM my objective was to be able to make my own website portfolio, however time
passed on and my skills went down. So when I took this class, I guess I was hoping that it would help me remember and give me more\
insight into what goes into a webpage, and web design in general.
