## "Where has the time gone?"
Lets be honest, its been years since the last time I posted to here. Life just kinda happened 
and updating the blog kinda fell into the background of things. Its quite remarkable how much
things have changed since my last post. Where to begin is really the better question...

After things fell through with ARX, I continued working on Mutant Football League and actually
recently restarted working on the game. Mutant Football League since then has released on all
platforms, Xbox One, Playstation 4, and is available on Steam and all over the world. Mutant
Football League has also released several DLC packs for players to purchase and download. 
Working on Mutant Football League has been a childhood dream come true. From playing the
original back in the day to working on the remake all through the development process has been
an amazing experience. Its truely something humbling to see people enjoy something you put your
heart and soul into. Honestly, its one of the best feelings in the world to me, and one of the
best part of being in video game development.

After work for Mutant Football League started to die down, I began looking for more game industry
work. I applied for a contract with EA Sports in Orlando to work on Madden and I got it. It was insane,
another childhood dream was in my grasp, I just needed to get there. It took a tremendous effort from 
my family, but they helped me get out there. Working at EA and on Madden was easily the best job that
I ever had and I loved every minute that I was there. The people I met and had the opportunity to work 
alongside in something that I am cherish for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, all going things must 
come to an end. The contract, that originally was a six month contract, was entended another six months
making it a year. Once I reached the year mark, I recieved a call that basically said that my contract 
was ending a month before I thought it was going to. Completely blindsided me.

Since then I have been tirelessly looking for another game industry job. In efforts to expand my creativity
and my chances of getting noticed and thus perhaps a job, I finally was able to finish a demo reel. I am 
damn proud of how it turned it out. Its funny I was worried about not having enough footage or enough content
really to put a demo reel together. Turns out, I had way more than enough. Ended up with a five minute demo 
reel. In my opinion is shows off what I worked on when I was with EA, my work on Mutant Football League, my
work with ARX and even a couple projects from when I was in college. Its just one of those things that im
definitely happy to have done and to be able to do it all myself too. Sometimes its just nice to have some
self validation. Something to show off for all of my hard work.

With that being said, im going to try and change. Try to do more things that I thought that I couldnt. Hopefully
involving taking up programming so I can try and turn my biggest weakness into a strength. Besides being able to 
code, as least to some extent, really would do wonders for my career and make me that much more versatile. But all
of that takes time, time which unfortunately seems I do not have a lot of as of right now. Anyways, we will see 
where things go from here.
