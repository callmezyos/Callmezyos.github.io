## The Experience of a Life Time
GDC and California was an amazing experience, something that I will not soon forget
from getting on a plane for the first time and getting out of the Midwest, to getting
to experience California all of it has made a lasting impression. Mostly, since returning
to Chicago, all I have been able to think about is forwarding my Game Design career and
moving things forward with my game Dym. I hope that sooner rather than later I will be 
able to fully move out there. 

When I got back, all I could think is, "I can't wait to go again."
