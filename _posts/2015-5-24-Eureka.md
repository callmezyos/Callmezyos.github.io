##Its Finally Live
After much anticipation my website (alexlueck.io) is finally live. I can't take all the credit though
I had a lot of help, both with the frontend, development and design, and the backend, website hosting and
the domain. It feels good to have finally made the site go live, it's by no means finished yet and
i'm very excited to see where things will go from here.
