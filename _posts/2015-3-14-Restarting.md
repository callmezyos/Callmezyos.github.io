## California Hangover
Ever since I came back from GDC and California I have found it kinda hard to get back into the
swing of things. Technically, my website portfolio and blog should have all gone live before
I left. However getting Dym polished became more of a priority. Well now that GDC has gone, I 
can focus more on getting Dym pushed further towards getting greenlit on Steam (someday) and
work more on my Unannounced Prject that I have been working on. I have been saying it for a 
while now that I would be putting up more examples and such of my work, that is all still 
coming. I'm just been too much of a perfectionist with my website. So I promise once that's all
done, I'll be able to do things more of the way that I want to do them.

Thanks for bearing with me....But there is still more to come.......Stay Tuned!
