This is the first post of a new series that I am trying out. I want to play games, mostly new but a mix in of 
everything from games I'm currently playing, have played, or have yet to play. After playing I want to basically 
analyze my gameplay and see what I liked and what I didn’t like about the game. Then post about it, either via a blog 
post on my website or a YouTube video or sorts. I'm sure I will figure that out as I move along. 
Thank you for joining me and lets jump right into the action…

Initially released October 26th 2018 (Opening the decade with a 2 year old game)
Developed by Rockstar Games - Rockstar North

I figured that I would start out this series and the decade for that matter with a game that I have been honestly addicted 
to for the last month. Red Dead Redemption 2 definitely is one of the best games to come out this past decade. An amazing 
single player story in combination with a revamped online really makes this game stand apart.

Once of the biggest accomplishments is how immersive of a world that they have created. Assuming players, like the wild wild 
west to even the most mild of extents can find a home in this game. The world is ripe with activity all over the map from 
Busy cities  to animal filled forests to high picturesque mountain tops. Not to mention the near endless supply of random 
encounters that happen throughout the world keep players on their toes and provide endless hilarious experiences. RDO features 
a main story line that is completed through online matchmaking. After playing through the amazing single player story, I found 
myself wanting more, so the next logical step was the world of Red Dead Online (RDO).

Players find that there is a TON to do whether your first starting out or a season vet there is always something to do. 
The idea of doing the online at first seemed rather daunting because as a primarily solo player stepping into the online world 
would leave me open to trolling from other posse's. However the online experience was completely different than what I thought.


Virtually everything can be done solo or with a posse. Of course the degree of difficulty changes whether your ridin' solo or 
with your buds. The introduction of the Specialist Roles really gives players a sense of purpose. Players can choose from 
being a Bounty Hunter, Collector, Trader, or a Moonshiner (Moonshiner was just recently added). Bounty Hunter is self-explanatory 
and technically so is the Moonshiner. The Moonshiner role also has its own story line for players to complete. The collector 
has the player collecting various variables that can be found around the map. The trader role allows for players to trade in 
whole animal carcasses and allows players to make money by doing supply and delivery missions. All of the roles have role ranks 
that increase as role objectives are completed. The higher the player is able to get their rank the more unlocks the player 
receives for the corresponding role. The new roles provide the best and most fun ways to earn money in the west.

Combat in the game various from sporadic skirmishes to full on fort assaults but are always fun. Players also have the option 
to do combat with or without Auto aim assist. Those that like the free aim option can join worlds just with other free aim 
players.

RDO is not perfect by any means. There are a number of bugs the players, myself included, run into almost on a daily basis 
that really distract the player from the game. By far one of the most annoying ones to run into is players camp's disappearing. 
Sometimes the icon will be on the mini map but the camp itself will disappear which makes interacting with anything and anyone 
in the camp impossible. A similar issue happens with the players Moonshine shack. Upon trying to  enter their moonshine shack 
sometimes the shack icon will disappear off the mini map then oddly enough the player cannot access the shack nor their horse 
and are basically forced to restart the game. I have run into several infinite load screens while loading into Moonshiner 
missions which I only fixed by restarting the game. I have also encountered immediately failing missions upon starting them 
as well.

The one constant thing players run into when playing basically any online game, the always annoying trolls. RDO has taken some 
steps into countering them so it doesn’t completely ruin the experience. If you are murdered, in which you inevitably will be, 
by another player randomly you are given the chance to "Press Charges" on them, which will place a bounty on that player. 
Player bounties can be picked up by Bounty Hunters of a high enough rank. Players can also just reload into the online mode 
and be transferred to a new server.

On an unrelated note with RDR2. I wrote an article not too long ago that covered the best way to make quick cash in RDR2 Online.
