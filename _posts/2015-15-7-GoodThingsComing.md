## The Good Things Keep On Coming

I know its been quite a while since my last blog post. I have just been super busy these
few weeks and haven't had any real spare time in quite some time. Well since the last update
I completed my first official contract for the fitness company. Only some minor updates are 
 really needed before its smooth sailing from there. On the other side, I have 
begun paid work for my other project. Better yet, both employers have hinted at giving me 
a full time opportunity. However, thats all if I don't some how manage to screw it up. 
Something kinda related, a friend of mine that I went to college with started his own legit 
game company, and he approached me about wanting to work with him on some projects. If my 
plate wasn't already full it is now haha. Now, I didn't want to dig myself into a hole so 
I told him that I already have a lot going on so he shouldn't expect me to jump into some
major role, but I will do what I can. It's all about the experience and what I learn from
the journey, needless to say, things have been pretty awesome and from the looks of it,
it's only going to get better.
