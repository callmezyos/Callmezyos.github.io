title: A Very Late New Years Resolution

## New Year, New Adventure

Well it's been over 6 months since the last time I even blogged an update. With the coming in
if the new year I figure what better way to usher things in with a post. So, what is my new year's
resolution? Last year it was to get further with my professional career and make more money. For 
the most part I accomplished getting farther ahead in my professional career. Not so much on the
make more money part. Anyways, this year is kinda the same, however this time around I want to
improve on what I have already accomplished. 

The last 6 months have been pretty interesting. Most importantly, I was recogized as an associate game
designer by someone in the game industry. For several months now I have been helping someone design
an indie video game (just being vague for NDA sake, sorry) and now it has finally gotten to the 
point where not only does he respect me and recognize me as equal, he has also trusted me to start
doing some more complicated designing.

*DISCLAIMER* I am working on a version of a football game with a designer I met at C2E2 this past year.

More complicated design, mostly meaning stadium design is going to be added onto my tasks of creating
teams. As far as the future of this, if I keep my current pace and keep on exceeding his
expectations I think he will keep me on at least for the duration of development of the game.
If things go even better, after the game releases, I will be hired on full-time as a desginer 
but that's all up in the air.

More recently, another one of my side projects, this one for a fitness company, expressed that they
might have an interest in bringing me on for more than just the project I am working on. In fact, they
might even want me to work for their company helping out their software. Even better news, this could
happen sooner rather than later. From what I'm being told, if things go as planned (which they barely
do) that I may be brought on as early as February.

Overall I think this year has started off pretty good. Needless to say I am excited to see where 
things are going to go if this is only the beginning. Let's kick some ass

Stay tuned yall!
