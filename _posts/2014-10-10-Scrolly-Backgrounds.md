##A Game of Shark and Minnow

The site in my opinion was great. I enjoyed how they were able 
to mix in the videos with scrolling. I found myself scrolling 
super slow just to see if I could make weird things happen with 
the video player. To me it looked like the parts with the videos
and animations were triggered using waypoints, and then transitions
were generated by where you were on the viewport. For example, scrolling
the mouse wheel down notch, the screen would fade into a lightly darker,
shade of grey. Overall I really enjoyed going through the site.
