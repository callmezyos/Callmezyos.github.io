title: The End of the Decade
---

Well we have reached another milestone, the end of the decade. This decade has been filled with a ton of ups and downs
Graduated High School, graduated college, met the love of my life, got my first job in the game industry, got my first game credit, first indie team
game credit, first AAA game worked on, and first AAA game credit just to name a few. A lot of that career progress only just
happened within these last couple years. Once I was able to work for EA, things started to roll a little more easily. I found that 
I started to generate more "buzz" so to speak. A few years ago, I would not have believed you if you had told me what my resume 
was going to look like if I stuck with my career in games and I am blessed to have made it this far. 

While the original idea behind this post was going to be a review of the decade, but as I started writing and kinda thinking about
it I realized that overall I had not made much progress over the coarse of the decade, granted I was finishing school and just 
getting my feelers out in the real world. I mentioned briefly that as far as my career is concerned, real growth has only just 
begun and shown up within these last couple years. Which then makes me wonder and think about if my time was spent wisely for the
growth of myself. So instead this post is more of a proclamation or a creed for the year and decade to come. Not is this just for
my own betterment, but the betterment of my girl and I's overall quality of life.

I need to further my career in the Game Industry and move on from doing contract work into a more permanent role.

I want to REALLY hone in my level and game design.

I want to produce more content anyway I can, whether its comics, a screenplay, photography, or making YouTube videos I just
want to make more content.

I have big plans for the future, so 2020 you best be ready!
