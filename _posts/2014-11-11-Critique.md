###Web Components & The Future of Development###

Personally I think this is a good path for the future of Web Development 
because as time goes on, developers are able to create things easier and more efficent.
The use of Shadow DOM and Templates allows content and presentation to be separated and
maintained. As some what of an ametuer web developer, I dont really see a 
problem with using sites like CustomElements to create apps. Anyone can
download and modify the code to use as they please for either their own personal
websites and apps. The only problem that I can think of would be that if people
become too comfortable using the CustomElements they may in a way lose their
skills, maybe.
