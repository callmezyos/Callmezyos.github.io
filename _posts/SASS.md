title: SASS or Not to SASS?

## Where I stand on SASS Preprocessors

Overall preprocessors seem like they can really make my code faster 
and more efficent. However, getting used to how they work and having
to use the command prompt make things slightly more challenging.
Learning SASS is difficult on its own, so to people that are maybe not 
the strongest programmers, SASS just adds that much more difficulty.

I will admit that I do like that SASS keeps everything very organized
and easy to find/read. However something that I continously find myself
getting stuck on is the proper syntax that should be used. The articles
mentioned that SASS isnt something that people can just pick up and mess
with a few times. Rather SASS should be somehow used and implemented into
every project to get more familiar.

In conclusion, I like the overall concept of SASS. I like to keep things organized 
and SASS organizes them almost perfectly. Since I am not the strongest programmer
implementing SASS would definately take some time, but in the end I know 
it would be worth it. The end result would have my code working more efficently,
and well organized.
