## The Experience of a Life Time
GDC and California was an amazing experience, something that I will not soon forget
from getting on a plane for the first time and getting out of the Midwest, to getting
to experience California all of it has made a lasting impression. Mostly, since returning
to Chicago, all I have been able to think about is forwarding my Game Design career and
moving things forward with my game Dym. I hope that sooner rather than later I will be 
able to fully move out there.

There really is too much to talk about, I mean right off the bat getting to San Fransisco was awesome.
I got to sit next to all of the higher up of High Voltage Software on the plane ride without even knowing 
it. It wasn't until we were getting off of the plane that I noticed one of their bags, unfortunately
I was too star struck to say anything. That same night we went out for drinks a short time after
landing in the city. Even then at the bar we were at a random guy approached me and began to talk to me
about the Packer apparal that I decided to wear. He said, " I lived in Milwakukee for 15 years, and those
are the best damn color I've seen all night," and this was only the first night.

The second day the Terrible Trio trio hit the Expo floor hard. We tried to stop at every possible table we could
and try to talk to as many people and make as many connections as we could. At the end of the day, we were physically
tired enough to the point that all we wanted to do was go back to the hotel and relax. This was after we stopped at one of the local taverns of course. Overall the second day I really didn't take too many pictures, or on the first day for that matter because of how determined I was in connecting with people on both the Expo floor and on the other side, where the job fair was basically happening.

Then finally the last day mainly just consisted of us being tourists and just walking around and trying the
different things rather than talking to the poeple behind them. It was more of a relax day because we knew that
soon we would have to be leaving the city.

When I got back, all I could think is, "I can't wait to go again."
