##SMACCS
Overall I would have to say that I like how SMACCS works in theory, but it seems a bit hard to implement consistently.
With SMACCS generally from what I have noticed all of the code is very DRY. Everything is specific and allows for elements to
be moved around the site without breaking. It also gives those elements the same general styling.

{%highlight CSS%}
.pod { width: 100%; } 
.pod input[type=text] { width: 50%; } 
.pod-constrained input[type=text] { width: 100%; } 
.pod-callout { width: 200px; } 
.pod-callout input[type=text] { width: 180px; }
{%endhighlight %}

Overall the only drawbacks or limitations that I really see with SMACCS is that the naming conventions for elements seem 
to be almost too specific, which to me, would make working on a site with a lot of separate elements rather difficult.
If done right and properly on the other hand, the code written in this style is very fluent, DRY, conventional, and
organized.
