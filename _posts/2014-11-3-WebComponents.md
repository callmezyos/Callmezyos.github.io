##Web Components

The information packed 30 minute video went over a lot of 
different types of Web Components and how to use them
effectively. Even in the begining of the video, the presenter
thought that the entire future of web delvelopment  couldn't be
covered in 30 minutes. He mentioned several Web Components, and 
their counterparts as well as their differences. I enjoyed how
he conducted a live demo to the audience, the presentation itself
was very interesting and informative. I haven't seen many keynote
speeches like that, or in general for that matter, but it was nice
how the speech was in a way similar to the way classes have been
held. Overall, the concepts he went over sound great, however
due to my coding skills I feel a bit overwhelmed at the idea of 
implementing some of these on my own, at this given point in time.
