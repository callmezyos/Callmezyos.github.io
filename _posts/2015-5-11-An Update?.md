title: Finally an Update!
---

## Another Year Older
I have been seriously slacking on the posting for a while now. Mostly that's due to being super busy
with school and preparing to finally graduate. So, since it's my birthday I figured why not finally
make a post and update all the fine people on what's been happening.

I know it's been weeks already, but I went to C2E2 and had a hell of a time. I only went for Friday 
of the event and it was jam packed full of awesomeness. It was my first C2E2 so at first I was overwhelmed
by the entire atmosphere. While walking around I somehow managed to talk to CM Punk a former Professional
Wrestler from Chicago.  On a side note, when I was growing up I was a huge wreslting fan but eventually
I grew out of it. Back to C2E2, later on in the day I ended up seeing some more Hame of Frame Wrestlers from
back in the day; Booker T, Road Warrior Animal, Rakiski, and Jerry "The King" Lawler were sitting at a table
and I was breifly able to exchange a few words (without having to pay). 

The real gem of the day though came when I moved over to the artists section of the conference. While moving
through the rows I discovered a "Mutant League Football" boothe. Naturally, this being a favorite game of mine
from back in the day when I first started playing video games, I stopped to see what was going on. After talking
to the gentlemen at the table I discovered it was the Designer that made it back then, Michael Mindheim. I was
awe struck for a bit. After some talking I mentioned that I was a Game Designer and when I did, he mentioned that
he was looking for designers to help on his game. I gave him my business card and he said he would email me.

Now catching up completely, since then I have had a business meeting with Michael and things are looking pretty good.
He offered me a chance to work along side him on a project. If I do a good enough job he may hire me full time at his
studio. What can I say things are looking up.

The ball is in my court.
