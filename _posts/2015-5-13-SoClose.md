##So Close I Can Taste It

With the days closing down on my college and schooling career, everything has started to finally
come together. For a couple months now, a friend and I have been working on my website portfolio
and it's come a long way. I am pretty much ready to make everything go live, however I have one
bug that is preventing me from moving forward. For some reason my buttons do not work when in the 
tablet mode. The problem was much worse at first, with the buttons not even working properly in desktop 
or tablet, but for some reason worked in mobile. After a few tweaks functionality returned to the desktop
versions, but not to the tablet version.

With Industry Night getting closer and closer, the time frame in order to get everything working properly
is getting smaller and smaller. Which leaves me no choice but to keep plugging away at it.
