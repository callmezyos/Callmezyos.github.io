##Are Older Browsers still relevant?

Eventhough technology is continuously advancing, their are people 
that still use outdated browsers. For myself, I believe that they
are still relevent, even with the recent advances in Technology. However,
developers shouldn't strain themselves making sure their content works
on these old browsers.

From what I have seen the people that are using the old outdated browsers
are mainly people that are just to lazy to update or are too scared to update
because they fear that they will not be able to use it correctly, or will not
know what they are doing. It't not always their fault, sometimes the machine
that people are using isn't the most up to date piece of equipment and they
are forced to used older broswers.

Overall developers can start to forget about some of the older less used Browsers,
and could still maintain functionality for the ones that, eventhough used less, 
still have some sort of prevelance with people.
